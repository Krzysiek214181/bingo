**bingo generator**
======================
this is just a basic bingo generator capable of generating up to 50 unique and highly customizable bingo cards at once

**settings**
============
current avaible settings are: 
* highly customizable freespot ( do you want it, where do you want it, what should it say )
* size of the board
* quantity of unique boards

i am planning on adding more setting for things like color customization, advanced printing settings, rules included in every bingo card, etc. in the future, for now if you want to change any of that you'll have to go into the css files yourself :/

if you have any ideas make sure to add them in the _issues_ tab

**backstory**
=============
i have this really boring biology teacher and i wanted to create a bingo for the whole class so that we could play it during the lesson, i've also wanted to learn JavaScript basics for a long time so i figured that his would be a good time to do both of those things. I found [this website](https://osric.com/bingo-card-generator/) and after messaging the author ( @cherdt ) i decided i want to do one of my own :)
